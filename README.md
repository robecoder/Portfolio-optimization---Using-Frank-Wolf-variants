# Portfolio-optimization---Using-Frank-Wolf-variants
Here are implemented the Classic Frank Wolfe, pairwise Frank Wolfe and the Frank Wolf Variant 2 descibed in Self-Concordant Analysis of Frank-Wolfe Algorithms of Pavel Dvurechensky, 
Petr Ostroukhov, Kamil Safin, Shimrit Shtern, Mathias Staudigl. With respect to this last variant, I created and  implementented a new heuristic 
to initialize the local Lipschistik constant for Self Concordant function
